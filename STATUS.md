  - [x] Read instruction document
  - [x] Parse with LLM
  - [x] Generate commands
  - [x] Execute modifications
- [x] Implement feedback loop
  - [x] Verify changes
  - [x] Handle errors
  - [x] Adjust commands if needed
- [x] Add basic processing
  - [x] Process documents from test-documents/
  - [x] Save to test-documents-updated/
  - [x] Generate processing report

### 7. Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ

- [x] Process test documents
  - [x] Create 'test-documents-updated' directory
  - [x] Process all documents in test-documents/
  - [x] Generate processing report
- [x] Unit tests

  - [x] End-to-end processing
  - [x] Error handling
  - [x] Format preservation

### 8. Known Issues üöß

1. Contract 1 processing:

   - Issue with finding "Definitions" heading - LLM needs to target "Definitions." (with period) exactly
   - Need to update LLM prompt to be more precise about punctuation in headings

2. Output formatting:

   - Some style preservation issues in complex documents
   - Need to enhance style matching for nested elements

3. Error handling:
   - Better error messages needed for failed commands
   - Need to implement retry logic for LLM calls
